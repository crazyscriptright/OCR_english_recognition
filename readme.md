# Name Recognition Using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates a machine learning-based approach to recognize names in textual data. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify words as names or non-names.

## Project Overview

The notebook contains the following key steps:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**
   - Load and prepare text data for training and testing.
   - Tokenize text and apply vectorization techniques to transform textual data into numerical features.

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Generate features to improve name recognition, including contextual and linguistic information.

3. **Model Selection and Training**
   - Train a machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, or other classifiers) using labeled data.
   - Evaluate the model's performance on validation and test sets.

4. **Evaluation and Results**
   - Use metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy to assess model performance.
   - Visualize the results for better interpretability.

## Prerequisites

To run the notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Required Python libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `nltk`

You can install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib nltk
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository or download the notebook file (`name-recognition.ipynb`).
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
3. Follow the cells sequentially to:
   - Load and preprocess the data.
   - Train the name recognition model.
   - Evaluate and interpret the results.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project must contain labeled text, where each word or token is annotated as a name or non-name. Ensure the dataset is preprocessed correctly to align with the notebook's format.

## Customization

- Replace the dataset path in the notebook with your dataset.
- Modify feature engineering or model hyperparameters to experiment with different configurations.

## Results

The notebook includes sections to display model performance metrics and visualizations. Customize these sections to suit your data and use case.
